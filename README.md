99problems
==========
This repo is dedicated to solving the 99 Haskell problems series at http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems.

The solutions here are not necessarily the 'easy' ones that use built-in features of the language, since this was done to learn the language.
